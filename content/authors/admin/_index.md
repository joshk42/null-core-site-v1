Hey, I'm nade. Welcome to the core, hope you enjoy this corner of the internet. 

I am what you might call "the originator" of null.core, responsible for much of what you see online. (Servers, Website, Discord, etc.) But I'm sure you already knew all that.\

What you may not know is that I was introduced to running my own servers in Linux in 2003. At the time, I had this sweet dual socket Pentium 2 server that my Dad found out by a dumpster near the warehouse that he worked in. I'm pretty sure that Counter-Strike was the first game server I ever ran on Linux and what really sparked my interest in LAN parties. 

The interest and experience that I gained from hosting my own servers for me and my friends eventually helped me carve out a career in IT as a Systems Administrator. 

I guess that's about it. Thanks!
